## Introduction

I've always wanted to know more than just the command line 
basics that we used to study in university. I wanted to explore 
more in Linux and aquire the skills of shell scripting since I'm 
interested in embedded systems and want to make my own build 
systems and set a professional environment for myself. Then 
eventually after searching for a gentle source, I 
found my way to this elegant and powerful book "[The Unix 
Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/)". It's a 
very good start if you want to grasp the 
concepts of shell scripting quickly and get your hands dirty on 
many useful and practical examples.
